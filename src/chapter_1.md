# Rethinking the Initial Concept

## Reflecting on the Journey of Poption

Over the past two years, I've been dedicated to developing a DeFi derivative known as Poption. However, I've recently decided to abandon this project. My initial belief in DeFi as a solution to the challenges I sought to address has waned. I'd like to share my thoughts and experiences on this journey with you, maybe we still can learn something from failure.

## Challenges in the Financial World
The economic landscape two years ago was marked by several extraordinary events in quick succession: the GME short squeeze, the WTI negative pricing, and the London Nickel squeeze. These incidents sparked my interest in devising ways to prevent such financial anomalies. I believe the following measures could be help:

1. **Contract Clarity:** Contracts need clear definitions from the outset. Amending a contract to change a non-negative number to an arbitrary real number mid-course can be disastrous. Any changes should be approached with extreme caution.
2. **Native market:** Utilizing distant markets with only similar products for hedging can introduce significant, unforeseen risks.
3. **Better option trade unit:** The market should avoid unnecessary naked short selling. As suggested by Elon Musk, Large players selling what they don't own is unfair. Instead, market makers could sell option combinations  like call/put spreads or butterflies as atomic to avoid to open high naked position, thereby mitigating risks like those seen in the GME situation.

## The Blockchain Solution and its Downfall

Initially, I believed blockchain could be the solution. Its trustless system and clearly defined smart contracts seemed ideal to provide **contract clarity** and **native market**. I envisioned a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the blockchain. The Dex enable people to trade my key inovation, Poption, a variant of the traditional option offering high capital efficiency without the need for naked selling.

A significant barrier was the lack of a substantial derivatives market within the blockchain domain. The traditional assert already servered by the traditional derivatve market. The crypto itself is high risk. There is little requirement to use derivatives to extract risk and swap them. Another problem is that the DeFi is not good enough, it is much more expansive.
