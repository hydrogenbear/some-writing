# Reassessing the Poption Project

## Insights from the Poption Endeavor

For the past two years, I have been engrossed in developing a DeFi derivative called Poption. Despite my efforts, I've decided to move away from this venture. My confidence in DeFi as a solution to the problems I aimed to solve has diminished. Nevertheless, I believe there's value in sharing the lessons learned from this experience, as we can often gain insights even from endeavors that don't pan out as expected.

## Identifying Financial Market Challenges

The financial landscape two years ago was punctuated by several significant events: the GME short squeeze, WTI's dive into negative pricing, and the London Nickel squeeze. These events inspired me to explore strategies to prevent such market anomalies. I came up with several approaches that could offer solutions:

1. **Contractual Precision:** It is crucial to have precise and unambiguous contracts from the start. Mid-course alterations, like changing a non-negative number to an arbitrary one, can lead to chaos. Thus, any contract modifications must be handled with utmost care.
2. **Hedging on Native Markets:** Relying on distant markets with only similar products for hedging introduces substantial and unforeseen risks.
3. **Rethinking the Atom unit in Option Trading:** The market should aim to reduce unnecessary naked short selling. Echoing Elon Musk's views, it is unfair for large entities to sell what they don't own. A viable alternative could be for market makers to trade in bundled option strategies such as call/put spreads or butterflies, which can help in managing high-risk positions more responsibly, as seen in the GME scenario.

## Blockchain: Potential and Pitfalls

Initially, I was optimistic about blockchain being the panacea. Its trustless nature and the clarity of smart contracts seemed to perfectly align with the needs for **contractual precision** and establishing **native markets**. My plan included a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the blockchain, facilitating trades in Poption, my innovative derivative designed to offer the benefits of traditional options but without the necessity for naked selling.

However, I encountered significant roadblocks. The lack of a robust derivatives market in the blockchain space was a major impediment. Traditional assets already well-served by conventional derivative markets didn't transition well into this new space. Furthermore, the inherent high-risk nature of cryptocurrencies reduced the demand for derivatives to manage and swap risks. Another critical issue was the inefficiency of DeFi; it proved to be more costly compared to traditional finance methods. 

This journey, though not successful in its original goals, has been a profound learning experience about the complexities and nuances of financial markets and the potential, yet limitations, of emerging technologies like blockchain.
